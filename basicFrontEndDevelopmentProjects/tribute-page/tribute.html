                        <ul>
                            <li> <strong>1475</strong> - MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI is born on March 6 in Caprese, a village near
                                Florence</li>
                            <li><strong>1488</strong> - Quits School and becomes Domenico's apprentice</li>
                            <li><strong>1489</strong> - Leaves Ghirlandaio and starts to study sculpture in the gardens of Lorenzo
                                de’ Medici</li>
                            <li><strong>1492</strong> - Lorenzo de’ Medici dies and Michelangelo goes back to live with his impoverished
                                father</li>
                            <li><strong>1497</strong> - Michelangelo moves to Rome. To a banker-client he sells his first important
                                work: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Michelangelo_Bacchus.jpg" target="_blank">BACCHUS</a>  and another Cupid, now lost. He makes his first trip to Carrara for marble.</li>
                            <li><strong>1498-1499</strong> - Sculpts the PIETÀ for the French cardinal Jean de Billheres (also
                                called Jean Villier de la Grolaie 0r Groslaye) but receives no other important commissions
                                for nearly two years.</li>
                            <li><strong>1504</strong> - His colossal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Michelangelos_David.jpg" target="_blank">DAVID</a>  is set up in front of the Palazzo della Signoria or City Hall.</li>
                            <li><strong>1564</strong> - His friend Daniele da Volterra watches him work all day February 12 on
                                the RONDANINI PIETÀ. Two days later he comes down with a fever but goes for a walk in the
                                cold night air, saying he just can’t rest. The next day he spends sitting next to the fireplace
                                but finally must crawl into bed. He dies on February 18. The Pope wants to have him buried
                                in St. Peter’s but Michelangelo’s nephew and heir, Leonardo, takes the body back to Florence,
                                where it is buried in Santa Croce. More than a hundred artists attend his funeral.e</li>
